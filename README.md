# SDL-Flying-Game

A simple, classic game in which you, by pressing buttons to keep "afloat", try to keep your white box from falling to the bottom of the screen, while also avoiding touching the top of the screen.

Different entities will spawn across the screen and move towards you, and you must avoid or collect them based on color:

  Black boxes will add 10 seconds to the timer.

  Blue boxes will add 100 to your score.

  Red and green boxes will end the game.

The goal is to get the highest score within the time limit.
